# WorkspaceOne.Forms-sdk

This repo contains documentation relating to Workspace ONE Forms SDK.

This repo is structured to feed into the [Omnissa Developer Portal](https://developer.omnissa.com) via the [https://github.com/euc-dev/euc-dev.github.io](https://github.com/euc-dev/euc-dev.github.io) repo using MkDocs and published by GitHub Pages. All documentation should be created in MarkDown format with the capabilities of MkDocs and the Material theme in mind. Only pages within the `/docs` folder should be modified within this repo.

Due to the age of this SDK, this documentation has not been integrated into the Omnissa Developer Portal, and is only provided [here](./docs/index.md).
